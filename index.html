<h2 class="main"><strong>The great Resignation is happening and you are missing out!!.</strong> </h2>
<p><strong>What is the great resignation you ask? Ok so the great resignation is the huge group
of people saying "I QUIT" at the same time. Wait ! Really? well in a nutshell, Yeah.
So, the great resignation is a wave that have arrived in the united states in the september
month of previous year and its effects can be seen all over the world. So, people from all
over the world are either quitting or thinking to quit and to be accurate around 40% of all
the  workforce globally is thinking of quitting or going for job hopping.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Reasons you ask, reasons I give-</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Low mental health of the employees:</strong> So, due to the pandemic people have
  seen there loved ones and many more people die and it has been devastating for them and have severly
affected their mental health and kicked in depression.In an article by <a href="#https://www.vox.com/">vox.com</a>
they have dove deep into the relation between the end of an pandemic and rising suicide rates. </li>
<li><strong>Covid Displacement:</strong> Many people due to covid had moved to a new location or shall I say
to a favourable and safe location , but due to reduction in restrictions by the government. Now, the companies
want their employees in the office and its just not possible to shift so easily and now they want to stay.</li>
<li><strong>Value of family:</strong> While people were dying everyday , it totally made us understand how important
our family is than work. So, people are just resigning for spending some more time with their family and find a new
job with better work-life balance.</li>
<li><strong>Understood the value of their time:</strong> So, when the whole world lockeddown people really understood that they
have many hours in a day and work can be completed at home also which can save alot of time spent on the commute or a taxi.
So, people are quitting to get a job in which they get more time to focus on themselves and side hustles.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed Resignation:</strong> People who already wanted to resign during or prior to the pandemic just
skipped it because it was very hard to find a new job and now that the pandemic is finally seeming to end , all the collective
resignations are happening now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bohot ho gyi theory, thore numbers pe aate h.</h2>
<p><strong>This great resignation was started in the second half of the year 2021 with each mont breaking each others
records. Alone in september 2021 4.5 million workers in the united states said "fuck u, and I QUIT" and left their jobs
breaking the record of the previous month of october where 4.2 million workes quit.I have already told you that almost 40
percent of the total workforce globally has admitted (reported by AL JAZEERA) that they are thinking of
quitting their jobs for better opportunities or just for the sake of doing it.Right now, there are 10.6 million openings
in the united states alone and total unemployed people there are just 6.9 million, which means there are 1.5 jobs per
unemployed people in united states.Normally more jobs is a good sign of an economy but this is different and leading
to ACUTE LABOUR SHORTAGE in the US. </strong></p>
<h2>To Ab Kya? Companies kuch nhi kr rhe kya?</h2>
<p><strong>Companies are working very hard to retain their existing workforce by offering almost 9% pay raise this year (not verified)
, they have also increased benefits for their employees and have opted for greater flexiblity and mobility. So, it seems like employees have
the upperhand right now. BUT!!!! IS IT ALWAYS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS? No, in fact that 72% of the workers who resigned in 2020
are regretting the decision and thinking of going back to their old jobs.</strong></p>
<h2>Choro Bhai hme kya, waise bhi world war 3 me duniya khatam hone wali h.</h2>
<p><strong>So, the main effect this resignation is gonna cause is WAGE-PRICE SPIRAL which i will explain at the last. Basically the
inflation rate in the US is alreary at an 50 years high and federal reserve is doing everything to slow it down but, it has
not yet been tested wether it is working or not. Russia-Ukraine conflict has further fueled this inflation by raising the
price of crude oil in the international market (currently at 106 dollars per barrel). Stock markets are already showing the
  negative returns for the year to NASDAQ almost 8% down this year. So, there is a saying "i would rather be at a recession than a bull
  market" because its very easy to find discounts and maximise gains.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Wage-Price Spiral</h4>
<p><strong>Wage Price spiral is a phenomena which happens when there happens an acute labour shortage or this type of disruptions
. So, in this due less labour companies are forced to either pay there existing employees more to stay or they have to fight
with other employers in term of salaries to get employees and it has resulted in companies to raise the prices of goods or services
that they offer leading to more profit to afford higher salaries. But , problem with this is that it is an endless spiral fueling
the inflation even more higher than it already is . So, this is the situation in a nutshell right now.
